        <p>Wayne State University is committed to providing the best possible environment for all individuals within the
            campus community. An important step in creating a truly inclusive community is to understand students,
            faculty, and staff perspectives and experiences related to their work and study. This survey is one of many
            surveys designed to help us gain insight and understanding about our community related to diversity, equity,
            and inclusion. The data collected will be used to understand the present climate within the Wayne State
            University School of Information Sciences program and to provide support for our current student body. Your
            participation and responses will be strictly confidential and will not be part of any medical, employment,
            or disciplinary record. No individual identifiable information will be collected or reported. This survey is
            completely voluntary and you may EXIT at any time using the <b>EXIT</b> link on the navigation bar above. If
            you choose to participate, please remember to <b>SUBMIT</b> your selections at the end of the survey. To
            accurately determine the student diversity composition in the SIS program it is important to complete this
            survey only once during each academic year of your program. If you would like to proceed, please click the
